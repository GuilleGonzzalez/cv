# My CV in LaTeX with AltaCV

This repository contains my curriculum vitae (CV) written in LaTeX using the [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) template, a modern and minimalist template based on `fontawesome5` and `academicons`.

## Repository Structure

- `cv_es.tex`: LaTeX file defining the CV content in Spanish.
- `cv_en.tex`: LaTeX file defining the CV content in English.
- `altaCV.cls`: AltaCV template file.

## How to Compile the CV

### Using VS Code

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you havenâ€™t already.
2. Install the **LaTeX Workshop** extension from the VS Code marketplace.
3. Ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (TeX Live, MiKTeX, etc.).
4. Open the repository folder in VS Code.
5. Open `cv.tex` and press `Ctrl + Alt + B` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Alt + B` (Mac) to build the document.
6. The compiled `cv.pdf` will be generated in the same folder.

### Using Overleaf

If you prefer to compile your CV online, you can upload the files to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and compile them directly in the online editor.

## Customization

To modify the CV content, edit the `cv.tex` file. You can change:

- Personal information (name, contact details, links, etc.).
- Sections and their content.
- Style and colors by modifying `altaCV.cls` if necessary.
